# Fundamentals

**Principles of Responsible Use**

1. **No open food and drink is tolerated.** If you have them, please place them outside.
2. **Do not touch the projection screen.** The screen material is a type of micro-perforated fabric that is vulnerable to physical impact. Please exercise restraint when moving within the facility.&#x20;
3. **Be excellent to each other**. The CRAIVE-Lab is a collaborative environment, and you are expected to be with other people at any given moment. Please be civil and respect each other's presence and use while in the facility. This principle includes working both within the physical space and virtually.

## System Control

Normally, you can control the CRAIVE-Lab's infrastructure using the System Dashboard (currently [Control Center](http://129.161.12.139:3000), new version is under development). This dashboard is powerful enough for you to enable and disable any hardware components as you wish.

Troubleshooting can also be done using the System Dashboard, although maintenance efforts are generally made by our researchers. For deeper knowledge about the infrastructure, please contact researchers in the [Collaboration](contributing-to-the-craive-lab.md) page.

More information about basic troubleshooting can be found in the [FAQs](faqs.md).

## Content Delivery

Currently, basic contents developed for the CRAIVE-Lab can be delivered using the [Pin-Up Platform](https://samuelchabot.com/). Here is a table of content types you can deliver using the platform:

| Content Type                 | Supported File Formats |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Images                       | .jpeg, .png, .gif      |
| Video                        | .mp4, .webm            |
| Audio                        | .mp3, .wav, .m4a       |
| Documents                    | .pdf                   |
| Websites                     | URL                    |
| Online Videos (YouTube only) | URL                    |
| Street View                  | URL                    |

Interactive applications, such as those produced using game engines, are currently delivered on-site. Works are underway to incorporate them into a more robust content delivery framework in the near future.
