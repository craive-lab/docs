# ðŸ”’ Unreal Engine (coming soon)

{% hint style="warning" %}
**We have an update!**

Our researchers are currently developing the special assets package for Unreal Engine. We expect the first version of this package to come out on GitHub at some point this summer!

In the meantime, please check this page for updates related to production in Unreal Engine.
{% endhint %}

## Versions

When using Unreal Engine at the CRAIVE-Lab, it is always recommended to use the latest version for best stability.&#x20;

Currently, the minimum version supported at the CRAIVE-Lab is **Unreal Engine 5.2**.

## Asset Packages

You can download all assets specific to the CRAIVE-Lab at the GitHub page. The assets, along with their documentations, are updated on a regular basis to reflect the state-of-the-art condition.&#x20;

Some of the assets has dependencies on other packages and software. Before using the assets, please ensure that you have all required dependencies stored in your own device.&#x20;

Due to logistical reasons, the CRAIVE-Lab currently does not have an Unreal Marketplace presence.
