# Unity

## Version

When using Unity at the CRAIVE-Lab, it is always recommended to use the latest **Long-Term Support (LTS)** version for best stability. You can download this version in Unity Hub, which can be found here.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
Currently, the oldest versions supported at the CRAIVE-Lab are **2020.3 LTS**.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Special Asset Packages

You can download all assets specific to the CRAIVE-Lab both at the GitHub page and at the Unity Asset Store. These assets, along with their documentations, are updated on a regular basis to reflect the state-of-the-art condition.&#x20;

Some of the assets has dependencies on other packages and software. Before using the assets, please ensure that you have all required dependencies stored in your own device.&#x20;

## Panoramic FPS Controller

See Step-by-Step Guides: Use FPS Controllers in Unity for more information.

{% hint style="warning" %}
You must install the Cinemachine package within your project in order to use the panoramic camera. In addition, if you are using the FPS extension, you also must install the new Input System package.
{% endhint %}

## Spatial Audio

Currently, the most reliable way of rendering spatial audio at the CRAIVE-Lab is through the use of Open Sound Control (OSC) protocol. A special asset package is available to facilitate such rendering, and is available via GitHub and the Unity Asset Store.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
The CRAIVE-Lab's spatial audio package uses Unity and Spat 5 in Max 8. If you are interested in offline usage, please download Max and Spat, and adjust the network configuration within the package accordingly. More information about this is available in the [Max + IRCAM Spat](max-+-ircam-spat.md) section.
