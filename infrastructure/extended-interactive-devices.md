  This section provides some additional information about integrated use of the
  CRAIVE-Lab's hardware, as well as more devices that can be used within the
  CRAIVE-Lab for extended interactions.

# Interactive Hardware

## Dashboard

{% hint style="warning" %}
Upgrade under development. Coming Fall 2024.
{% endhint %}

For research purpose only, the Dashboard (previously Control Center) is open-source partially open and available upon request. We encourage PhD students to contribute to its development, and we welcome suggestions from all students about new hardware features they would like to see!

## Affiliated interactive hardware

Here is a table of interactive devices that have previously been deployed for content creation at the CRAIVE-Lab:

{% hint style="warning" %}
Head-mounted devices (HMDs) can be used within the CRAIVE-Lab. However, for optimal user interaction, it is recommended that their use be limited to augmenting projected contents.
